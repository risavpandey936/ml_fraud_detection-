Machine Learning Classification Project
This project implements various machine learning algorithms for classification tasks, focusing on fraud detection using a real dataset.

Algorithms Used
Several classification algorithms are explored including:
1.Logistic Regression
2.Bagging with Logistic Regression
3.Random Forest
4.Boosting algorithms (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting)
5.XGBoost
Best Performing Model: Random Forest
Among the classifiers tried, Random Forest demonstrated the best performance on this dataset. It effectively handled the complexity and imbalance of the fraud detection data by aggregating decisions from multiple decision trees, resulting in higher accuracy and reliability.
